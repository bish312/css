      <h2>Time to rest and visit most beautiful place in the World.</h2>
      <p>Kyrgyzstan is a country that captured our imagination from the very first time we entered its border from Kazakhstan. It has beautiful unspoiled mountains, crystal-clear mountain lakes,  a fascinating culture, and interesting traditions.</p>

        <h3>1. Tons of alpine lakes, rivers, and hot springs</h3>
        <p>Kyrgyzstan has a huge water reserve and that means there are plenty of lakes, streams, and rivers all over the country. Kyrgyzstan has more than 2000 lakes and 40,000 rivers. The country has a huge still untapped potential for watersports like kayaking and whitewater rafting. These activities only became popular quite recently but you can already find a few local tour operators who organize kayaking and rafting trips.</p>

        <h3>2. The many hiking and trekking trails</h3>
        <p>Kyrgyzstan is a hiker’s paradise. The country has thousands of mountain trails that reach high peaks, gorgeous passes, and beautiful alpine lakes. For outdoors enthusiasts like us, this Central-Asian country was the perfect destination. Cynthia and I absolutely love the mountains and hiking on far, off-the-beaten-path trails.</p>

        <h3>3. The rich cultural heritage</h3>
        <p>The culture of Kyrgyzstan is just fascinating. The Kyrgyz people are mainly Muslim, they speak Russian and Kyrgyz and generally have Asian features. They share many affinities with the nomadic people of Mongolia. A few of these affinities, for example, are the use of yurts during summer and the practice of hunting with Eagles. People in Kyrgyzstan also live semi-nomadic lives.</p>

        <h3>4. World Nomad Games</h3>
        <p>First held in 2014, and now held every two years, the World Nomad Games gathers athletes, artists, craftsmen, and visitors from around the world. In previous years, delegations from almost every continent (except Antarctica) have competed, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, China, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. The sports and competitions feature different games that have existed for centuries, including races, horse games, hunting demonstrations, and wrestling.</p>

        <h3>5. Issyk-Kul - beautiful and clean alpine lake </h3>
        <p>Issyk-Kul is the world’s second largest alpine lake, lying at 1609 m (5,279 feet) above sea level. Even though it is surrounded by mountains, Issyk-Kul never freezes, thus its name means “hot lake” in Kyrgyz. The lake itself is surrounded by protected marshlands, two mountain ranges, and many popular resorts and destinations, including Karakol and Cholpon-Ata. Issyk-Kul is well known for its many resorts, spas, and sights, all of which combine to make the region one of the most popular in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
